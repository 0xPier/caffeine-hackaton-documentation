## **What problem does it solve?**

MicroMentor solves the asymmetry in the mentorship market. For mentees, it eliminates the barriers of finding qualified mentors by providing a searchable, filterable database of experts with transparent pricing and verified reviews. For mentors, it removes the administrative burden of managing consultations, handling payments, and building credibility. The escrow payment system (supported but not implemented yet) protects both parties - ensuring mentees only pay for completed sessions while guaranteeing mentors receive payment for their time. This creates trust in what is traditionally an informal, unstructured market.

## **How did you build it?**

Using Caffeine, I developed a full-stack web application with role-based authentication, real-time session management, and integrated payment processing support. Caffeine's capabilities enabled me to implement complex features including user authentication with persistent sessions, dynamic mentor discovery with search and filtering, Stripe payment integration with escrow functionality (available but as mockup now), and a comprehensive dashboard system for both mentors and mentees. The platform leverages Caffeine to handle backend operations, data storage for users, sessions, reviews and transactions and creates a responsive, intuitive user interface.

## **What's the potential impact on users or on the industry?**

MicroMentor has the potential to transform how professional knowledge is shared and monetized. For users, it democratizes access to mentorship, potentially accelerating career growth and reducing the advantage gap between well-connected and isolated professionals. For the industry, it creates a new economy around knowledge transfer, enabling experts to build sustainable consulting practices while maintaining their primary careers. At scale, MicroMentor could become the standard infrastructure for professional mentorship, similar to how platforms like Uber transformed transportation or Airbnb transformed hospitality - making mentorship more accessible, transparent and efficient globally.
